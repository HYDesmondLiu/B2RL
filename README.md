# B2RL

## Building Batch Reinforcement Learning Dataset


 Batch reinforcement learning (BRL) learns exclusively from static datasets (i.e. replay buffers). Thus, generating replay buffers are crucial for BRL model benchmark. In our B2RL (Building Batch RL) dataset, we collect real-world datasets from our database, as well buffers generated by several behavioral policies in simulation environments. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to open-source building datasets for the purpose of batch RL learning.
